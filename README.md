# 📸 SkillRack Capture Tool (Windows Application)

**SkillRack Capture Tool** is a **Windows desktop application** designed to take **full-page screenshots** of SkillRack problems (or any webpage) using **Microsoft Edge**.

It captures the **entire webpage in one image**, even content that requires scrolling, and can now also **convert captured images into PDFs automatically**.

No Python. No coding.
Just **run the EXE and press `S`**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Tool Exists

SkillRack problems:

* Are long and scrollable
* Need proof screenshots
* Are tedious to capture manually

Normal screenshots:

* Capture only visible area
* Miss hidden content
* Waste time

This tool solves that with **one key press** 🎯
…and now also helps you **organize screenshots into PDFs** 📄

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Understand the Interface

#### Folder Navigation Bar

* **Back ◀** → go to previous folder
* **Forward ▶** → go to next folder
* **Path Bar** → type any valid folder path and press **Enter**

Works like a mini file explorer 🗂️

### 🔹 Step 5: Capture Screenshot (MAIN ACTION)

| `ESC` | Exit application safely      |

⚠️ Press **ESC** only when you want to close the tool

---

## ⏸️ Pause and Resume Capture (IMPORTANT)

### Why Pause?

While typing:

* Code
* Answers
* Search text

You may accidentally press **S**.

### How to Pause

1. Click **“Pause Capture”**

3. Pressing `S` will do nothing

### Resume

1. Click **“Resume Capture”**
2. Status changes to **RUNNING**

## 🖼️ Screenshot Output Format

All screenshots are:

* 📄 Format: **PNG**
* 🕒 Named using date and time

Example:

```
2026-01-22_21-55-30.png
```

This avoids overwriting and keeps files organized.
