# 📸 SkillRack Capture Tool (Windows Application)

**SkillRack Capture Tool** is a **Windows desktop application** designed to take **full-page screenshots** of SkillRack problems (or any webpage) using **Microsoft Edge**.

It captures the **entire webpage in one image**, even content that requires scrolling.

No Python. No coding.
Just **run the EXE and press `S`**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Tool Exists

SkillRack problems:

* Are long and scrollable
* Need proof screenshots
* Are tedious to capture manually

Normal screenshots:

* Capture only visible area
* Miss hidden content
* Waste time

This tool solves that with **one key press** 🎯

---

## 🖥️ System Requirements

Before using, ensure:

* ✅ **Windows 10 or Windows 11**
* ✅ **Microsoft Edge installed** (default on Windows)
* ✅ Internet connection
* ❌ No Python required
* ❌ No browser extensions required

---

## 📦 What You Get

After download/extraction:

```
SkillRackCapture.exe

That’s all.

## ▶️ Step-by-Step Usage Guide (VERY IMPORTANT)

### 🔹 Step 1: Launch the Application

1. Double-click **`SkillRackCapture.exe`**
2. A window titled **“SkillRack Capture Tool”** opens
3. Microsoft Edge will open automatically

⚠️ Do **not** close Edge

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Login to SkillRack

2. Go to **SkillRack**
3. Login normally with your credentials
4. Open the **problem / unit / page** you want to capture

👉 The tool does **not** log in for you

### 🔹 Step 3: Select a Folder (MANDATORY)

Before capturing screenshots, you **must select a folder**.

#### Option A: Select Existing Folder

1. Click **“Select Folder”**
2. Choose any folder (Desktop, Documents, etc.)
3. The selected path appears in the path bar
4. This becomes the **active save location**

#### Option B: Create a New Subfolder

1. Click **“Create Subfolder”**
2. Enter a name (example: `Unit_3`)
3. Subfolder is created
4. Tool automatically switches into it

📁 Screenshots will now be saved here

### 🔹 Step 4: Understand the Interface

#### Folder Navigation Bar

* **Back ◀** → go to previous folder
* **Forward ▶** → go to next folder
* **Path Bar** → type any valid folder path and press **Enter**

Works like a mini file explorer 🗂️

### 🔹 Step 5: Capture Screenshot (MAIN ACTION)

1. Make sure:

   * Edge is open
   * SkillRack page is visible
   * Capture status shows **RUNNING**
2. Press the **`S` key** on your keyboard

## ⌨️ Keyboard Controls (VERY IMPORTANT)

| Key   | What It Does                 |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| `S`   | Capture full page screenshot |
| `ESC` | Exit application safely      |

⚠️ Press **ESC** only when you want to close the tool

---

## ⏸️ Pause and Resume Capture (IMPORTANT)

### Why Pause?

While typing:

* Code
* Answers
* Search text

You may accidentally press **S**.

### How to Pause

1. Click **“Pause Capture”**
2. Status changes to **PAUSED**
3. Pressing `S` will do nothing

### Resume

1. Click **“Resume Capture”**
2. Status changes to **RUNNING**
3. Screenshots work again

## 📁 Screenshot Output Format

All screenshots are:

* 📄 Format: **PNG**
* 🕒 Named using date and time

Example:

```
2026-01-22_21-55-30.png
```

This avoids overwriting and keeps files organized.
